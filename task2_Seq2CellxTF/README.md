# Task2: Using short regulatory sequence to predict cell type specific transcription factor bindings

# Briefing

Text:

Features:
- Input dimension: relative small - around 1kb
- Sample size: number of the binding region is large
- Ourput dimension: huge - over 2000 (and can be more)
- Prior knowedge on output dimension: TF binding motif, TF RNA expression.
